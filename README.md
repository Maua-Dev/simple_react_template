# simple_react_template

Template base for creating a front-end application using the React library.

###### install packages
    npm install
    yarn install


## Scripts
To run the application, it's important to use a package manager tool such as yarn or npm.

###### start
    npm run start
    yarn start

Runs the app in the development mode. 
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. 
The page will reload when you make changes.

###### test
    npm run test
    yarn test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

###### build
    npm run build
    yarn build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.

###### eject
    npm run eject
    yarn eject

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back! 
This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
