# simple_react_template

Template base for creating a front-end application using the React library.




## Scripts
To run the application, it's important to use a package manager tool such as yarn or npm.
```http
  npm run dev
  yarn dev
```
Runs the app in the development mode. 
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. 
The page will reload when you make changes.

```http
  npm run test
  yarn test
```
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

```http
  npm run build
  yarn build
```
Builds the app for production to the build folder.

```http
  npm run eject
  yarn eject
```
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back! 
This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
